# swiper

Fuzzy search lines in current window. 

Supports regex, negate, match highting, case sensitive search. 

a copy of emacs swiper: the thing I missed most in vscode.

Search `"swiper !not Test"` matches a line with `SWiPeR Test` without mentions of `not` string.

![DEMO](./img/swiper-silver.gif)

## Installation

Install this extension.

## Commands

`swiper.swiper-word-at-cursor` search the current word at cursor.

`swiper.swiper` search the last value tried.

## Quick tutorial

Invoke command `Swiper: Swiper` and start typing.

basic rules:

1. Search either literal string or javascript regex `/.../`
2. Search strings separated by space are AND-ed together. e.g. "a b" matched lines with "a" and "b" on the same line.
3. Search string prefixed with `!` negates the search, "a !b" matches lines with "a" but not "b". Use regex `/\!/` if you want to match `"!"` literal string.
4. Default case insensitive search. Upcased search term matches case sensitively.

Some quick Example:

```sh
# search wildcard
/command.*swiper/

# lint OR display 
/lint|display/

lint|display # searches the literal string "lint|display"
# line starts with test 
^test

a B # matches "aB", "AB"
```

## Motivation

I come from emacs to VScode, vscode is awesome, but misses a few features i do daily in emacs. This is one of them.

I wrote a [blog](https://medium.com/@wenhoujx/boot-productivity-with-vscode-tasks-c98fa0f8b567) that covers achieving some my other emacs workflows in VScode.

## TODO

- [ ] somehow test on non-macOS?
- [x] search all file in the workspace.
    >  Use VScode search feature.
- [x] if upper case char typed, turn to case sensitive search for that subSearchString.
    > Done
- [x] do not save tmp file for unsaved buffer.
